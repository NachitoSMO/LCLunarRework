# Lunar Rework
## A rework of Lethal Company's Moon system.

This mod aims to make visiting different planets during gameplay more rewarding by adding a new scrap spawning mechanic as well as other misc changes.

## Scrap Gain

- After leaving a moon, every single moon except the last one you've been to will **gain scrap**.
- Depending on the moon, the amount of scrap in each moon will increase from 1 to 3 per **day not visiting said moon**.
- This effect *stacks* until you reach a **hard cap**, which varies depending on the moon.

## Rebirth

- For an initial 8000 credits, you may purchase a Rebirth by typing 'rebirth' into the Terminal.
- Once purchased, your Profit Quota will **loop back to 130** next quota fulfill.
- The Scrap Gain and cap of each moon will also be **doubled**.
- The cost of Rebirth will increase by 5000 credits after each purchase.

## Major Changes

- After visiting a moon, the ship will automatically reroute to the Company. This means **you must pay again in order to re-visit high-tier moons**.
- Moon prices have been slightly altered.
- Artifice's scrap amount has been reverted to that of v56. This results in a major buff.

## Misc changes

- Selling early will now return the full value of the items in credits. However, the amount of quota fulfilled stays the same.

## Notes

This mod depends on the StaticNetcodeLib patcher and TerminalAPI.

As of 0.0.3, many of this mods' values can be configured. (Note that in the case of the cost of Rebirth, they won't apply until you create a new save file.)

This mod will likely break with:
- Mods that tamper with scrap amounts in base moons.
- Mods that tamper with the Moons Catalogue in the Terminal (The text might look messy and/or you might lose information on Scrap Gain amounts).

This mod is currently in **Alpha**. Numbers are subject to change and bugs remain to be found.
